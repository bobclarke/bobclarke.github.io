<p><span>My understanding of how this differs from simple feature branches:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>To start with, two branches exist named <b>master</b> and <b>develop</b> (the dev branch is derived from master)</span></li>
<li><span>Developers create and work on <b>feature</b> branches from the <b>develop</b> branch in the usual way and these are merged back into the <b>develop</b> branch regularly via pull requests.</span></li>
<li><span>If using semantic versioning, the minor number (2nd field) is incremented each time a backwards compatible feature is added. A non backwards compatible feature (breaking feature) would result in the major number (1st field) being incremented. </span></li>
<li><span>When it is decided that a release is due, a <b>release</b> branch is created from the <b>develop</b> branch. New features can still be added to the <b>develop</b> branch via feature branches in the usual way.</span></li>
<li><span>A deployable artifact is built from the <b>release</b> branch and the artifact is deployed to the appropriate test environments.</span></li>
<li><span>The deployed artifact is tested and any bug fixes are carried out on the release branch. Bug fixes increment the patch number (3rd field) of the semantic version number. <b>NOTE</b>: Only bug fixes can be carried out in the release branch. No features can be added to the release branch.</span></li>
<li><span>When all bugs are resolved and the release is finalised, the release branch is merged into both <b>develop</b> and <b>master</b> branches and <b>master</b> is also tagged with the semantic version number.</span></li>
</ol>
