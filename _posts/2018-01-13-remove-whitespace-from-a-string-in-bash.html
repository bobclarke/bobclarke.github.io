<p>If the file /etc/foo.props contained:</p>
<pre>context-root= /app1 
http_port= 8080 
admin-port= 9090</pre>
<p>... and you were using</p>
<pre>http_port=$(cat /foo/props.conf | grep http-port | cut -d = -f 2</pre>
<p>$http_port would end up being prefixed by whitespace, which would be a problem if you were using this to construct a URL in a script. To resolve this, you could use xargs as follows:</p>
<pre>http_port=$(cat /etc/foo.props | grep http-port | cut -d = -f 2 | xargs)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
