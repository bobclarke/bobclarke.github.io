<meta name="description" content="Just finished a weekend of being totally confused about k8s ingress. I&#39;m glad to say that I finally managed (using my OCD powers and lots of snacks/coffee) to work out what&#39;s going on. Here&#39;s what I learned. (NOTE: I&#39;m doing this on Minikube with no add-ons) The confusion I experienced was made worse by several guides that skipped over the key detail that was confusing me, i.e the ingress-controller, because they either: - Assumed I was running on GKE which handles the ingress-controller automatically - Assumed I had enabled ingress in Minikube as an add-on which also handles the ingress-controller automatically Now, call me old fashioned, but when I&#39;m learning something I like to do everything myself so that I fully understand every piece. Oddly enough, a couple of guides were plain wrong and exposed the services they were publishing via ingress as NodePort. This really confused me because the ingress controller is inside the cluster, along with the services it&#39;s routing to and therefore can contact the services &quot;natively&quot; on their ClusterIP. The point here (and this sounds obvious to me now but before the penny dropped it wasn&#39;t) is that the only service that needs to be exposed to the outside world when using ingress is the service that sits in front of the ingress controller itself. The aim of this guide is to: - Help me not forget what I learned (always good to write things down) - Maybe help other out people that might find ingress confusing. So here goes...

I originally left this blank which means that any hostname or IP specified in the URL would be acceptable. however when I did this the nginx controller kept trying to redirect me (via a 308) to https.

    <p>Just finished a weekend of being totally confused about k8s ingress. I'm glad to say that I finally managed (using my OCD powers and lots of snacks/coffee) to work out what's going on. Here's what I learned. (NOTE: I'm doing this on Minikube with no add-ons)</p>
<p>The confusion I experienced was made worse by several guides that skipped over the key detail that was confusing me, i.e the ingress-controller, because they either:<br />

<p>As can be seen from the above, the only service exposed to the outside world is the <b>ingress-controller</b> service</p>
<p>Running <b>minikube service list</b> produces the following result:</p>
<pre>|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
|  NAMESPACE  |         NAME         |             URL             |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| default     | default-backend      | No node port                |
| default     | hello-world          | No node port                |
| <b>default     | ingress-controller   | http://192.168.99.100:32000</b> |
| default     | kubernetes           | No node port                |
| kube-system | kube-dns             | No node port                |
| kube-system | kubernetes-dashboard | http://192.168.99.100:30000 |
| kube-system | tiller-deploy        | No node port                |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|</pre>
<p>and putting http://minikube:32000/hello-world into a browser results in the message <b>Hello Kubernetes!</b></p>
<p>And there you have it, hopefully I haven't missed anything.</p>
