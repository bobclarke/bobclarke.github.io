I"¢<p>The syntax is:</p>
<pre class="code">rex field=<i>splunk data field</i> "(?regex)‚Äù</pre>
<p>For example:<br />
If your splunk _raw field contained the line ‚ÄúThe sky is blue‚Äù and you wanted to<br />
get the word blue and assign it to a variable of COLOUR, you would do the following:</p>
<pre class="code">sourcetype="your_source_type" source="/etc/foo/bar" | rex field=_raw "The sky is\s+(?\w+)\.*"
</pre>
<p>i.e ‚ÄúThe sky is‚Äù followed by one of more spaces, followed by one or more word characters (which are assigned to the variable COLOUR) followed by 0 or more of any characters. i.e, standard regex but instead of putting the assignment braces around only the (\w+) you also insert ? to the left of it, so you end up with (?\w+)</p>
<p>Now you have a variable called COLOUR you can pipe it to a table</p>
<pre class="code">sourcetype="your_source_type" source="/etc/foo/bar" | rex field=_raw "The sky is\s+(?\w+)\.*" | table COLOUR</pre>
<p>Here‚Äôs a real world example, to pull out the http method, response code and uri from apache‚Äôs access logs and render them in a table:</p>
<div id="post-body-6765486644803036963" class="post-body entry-content">
<pre class="code">sourcetype="myproject:ihs" source="/usr/websphere*/ihs*" | rex field=_raw "(?&lt;METHOD&gt;POST|GET|PUT)\s+(?&lt;URI&gt;.*\s+)\.*HTTP/1.1\"##(?&lt;CODE&gt;\d+)" | table host, CODE, METHOD, URI
</pre>
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="post-footer"></div>
