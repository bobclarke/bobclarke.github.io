I"@<p>To inject a script into a Pod, it’s simple enough to use a config map, however if you try to chmod the script to make it executable you’ll get an error telling you that the file system is read-only.  This is easily solved by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaultMode</code> parameter</p>

<p>Here, I’m setting up a volume called pg-backup-script (which is pointing at a configMap named hadoop-ra-postgresql-backup-cm) and I’m setting it’s filesystem permissions to -rwxr–r–. I’m then mounting it in the container under /tmp.</p>

<p>As can be seen, the configMap data has a “key” of backup.sh, which is now executable</p>
