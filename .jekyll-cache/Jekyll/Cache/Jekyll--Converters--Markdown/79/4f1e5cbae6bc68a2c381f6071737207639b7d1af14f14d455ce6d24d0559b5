I"¥<p>Letâ€™s say Iâ€™m contributing to Github projects at work and Iâ€™m also contributing to Github projects that are not work related. In all likelyhood Iâ€™ll do this using different Github accounts, however I may be working on the same machine for both work and personal projects for convenience. With this in mind, I need a way for my git cli to automatically detect which SSH key to use depending on the project.</p>
