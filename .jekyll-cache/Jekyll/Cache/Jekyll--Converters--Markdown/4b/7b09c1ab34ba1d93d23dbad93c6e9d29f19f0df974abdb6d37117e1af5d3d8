I"	<p>One use case for looping in terraform is if you need to provide a list of values. The example below shows the installtion of the nginx-ingress Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster. In this particular case weâ€™re setting up <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/">TCP Services</a> which requires a list of one of more arguments. We could just as easily provide a values file however the technique show below deomonstrates the use of a templating and looping nicely</p>
